When writing commit messages, follow these rules:

Keep messages short and concise. Focus on product impact and user-facing changes. Avoid mentioning implementation details, file names, or line numbers.

Format: <type>: <short description>

Types:
- feat: New features or significant product capabilities
- fix: Bug fixes that affect user experience
- perf: Performance improvements visible to users
- refactor: Code refactoring (use sparingly, only for major architectural changes)
- docs: Documentation updates
- chore: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, tooling, etc.)

Good examples:
- feat: Add user story retry validation
- fix: Resolve graph visualization loading issue
- perf: Improve agent exploration speed by 40%
- feat: Support multiple LLM providers
- fix: Handle authentication failures gracefully

Avoid:
- fix: Update error handling in agent-service.ts
- refactor: Extract helper function for DOM parsing
- chore: Update TypeScript version
- fix: Add null check in line 42
- refactor: Rename variable from x to y

Guidelines:
1. Write from user perspective - What does this change enable or fix for users?
2. Be specific but concise - "Add retry validation" is better than "Update retry" or "Fix stuff"
3. Skip file names and line numbers - The diff shows where changes were made
4. Avoid technical jargon - Use product/feature language when possible
5. Group related changes - One commit per logical change, not per file
